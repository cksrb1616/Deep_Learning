VGG Network uses small sized "3x3" convolution filters(fc) at the end => deepen the depth of the layer
=> Higher performance (lower error rate)

Simply depth of layer is related to good performance? No
Still parameter is too many
=> ResNet is solution (which use Residual Block)
=> lower the difficulty of optimization

Actually it is difficult to installed or contained mapping, H(x), is difficult to directly learn.
Therefore, F(x) = H(x)-x is learned as a instead.
Previously learned result x, x identity, is brought then residual F(x) is learned.
Summing up of x and F(x) will be H(x) but it is faster.
